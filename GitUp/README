##    Description-
##    This script is designed to manage multiple GIT repositories
##        and from multiple sources, i.e. github, gitlab, and
##        local/network remote repos.
##    It is based on the Idea that you want to edit code in 1 (ONE)
##        repo, sync those changes to all your local repos, and then
##        add/commit/pull/push all of them to the remote 'origin/s'
##    It will perform the following functions-
##        Log all output to a logfile, and rotate them depending
##            on size and number, with timestamps in the log and
##            on the tar backup filenames.
##        Perform a add/commit/pull/push on the ONE working local repo
##        Sync the ONE working local repo with all other local repos
##        Perform a add/commit/pull/push on all the other local repos
##    Usage-
##    Modify the path/s to your local git repo directory/s
##    Run the script with no options to perform all tasks
##    Run the script with [help] option to show this info and exit.
