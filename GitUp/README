##    Description-
##    I started out having only one git remote repo, local network,
##        then I got a github account and maintained both, and when
##        MS aquired github, I installed GitLab Server locally, and
##        opened a Gitlab.com account and was maintaining all 4 repos.
##    This script is designed to manage and sync multiple GIT 
##        repositories and from multiple sources, i.e. github, gitlab,
##         and local/network remote repos.
##    It is based on the Idea that you want to edit code in 1 (ONE)
##        repo, sync those changes to all your local repos, and then
##        add/commit/pull/push all of them to the remote 'origin/s'
##    It will perform the following functions-
##    *   Log all output to a logfile, and rotate them depending
##            on size and number, with timestamps in the log and
##            on the tar backup filenames.
##    *   Perform a add/commit/pull/push on the ONE working local repo
##    *   Sync the ONE working local repo with all other local repos
##    *   Perform a add/commit/pull/push on all the other local repos
##    Usage-
##    Modify the path/s to your local git repo directory/s
##    Run the script with no options to perform all tasks without user input.
##    Run the script with [help] option to show this info and exit.
##    Run the script with [ask] option to input the commt message manually.
